# gmail-spam-detector
The Chrome extension automatically scans the content of opened emails in Gmail and sends the text to a locally running Flask API. The API uses a trained machine learning model to predict whether the email is spam or not, and the result is displayed instantly in the Gmail interface and in the extension popup.
